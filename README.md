Title: PHP CMS
This my first Content Managment System (CMS) in PHP.
This first version will use jQuery and Bootstrap v4. Subsequently I will use
the all powerful VueJs for the frontend while PHP and MySQL power the backend.

My personal aim in this project is to achieve the following:

1. Master PHP MVC
2. Master routing and autoloading
3. Understand project design
3. Master Object-Oriented Programming
